      "value": "<p class=\"p2\" style=\"text-align: justify\">Myrmidian Warrior Priests march to war armed with great polished bronze shields, used to reflect the glare of the sun and give the impression of a fiery horde going to battle. Ranged attacks made against bearers of the shield incur a -20 Ballistic Skill penalty if the attacker is facing the front of shield. This penalty increases to -30 in areas or during the time of day the sun is at its brightest, as the reflected light dazzles attackers; likewise, the penalty is reduced to -10 in low-light conditions, such as nighttime when the moon is out. The shield inflicts no penalty in fully darkened conditions without a light source. In addition, as an Action the wielder can actively use the shield to reflect sunlight at a nearby foe, dazzling and blinding them. The target must succeed a <strong>Difficult (-10) Initiative Test </strong>or gain +1 @Condition[Blinded]<em> </em>Condition. If the creature has no eyes this shield has no effect.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">Â </span></p>"
