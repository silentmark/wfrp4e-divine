You immediately make a Breath attack, as if you had spent 2 Advantage to activate the @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-core.items.Item.uqGxFOEqeurwkAO3]{Breath} +5 (Fire) Creature Trait. All characters within Fellowship Bonus yards of that target are struck, as are all characters between the creature and the target. Perform an Opposed <strong>Pray/Dodge</strong> Test against all affected targets (adding the SLs from the initial Pray Test to your result). All targets that fail take Damage equal to the attack’s Rating. For every +2 SL you increase the Breath Rating by +1.</p>"
