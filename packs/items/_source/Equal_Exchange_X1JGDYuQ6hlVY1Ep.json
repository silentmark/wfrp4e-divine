Any crime committed against you during the duration, or within Fellowship Bonus minutes prior to the Miracle being cast, is immediately returned upon the criminal. If a thief stole your purse, the thief ’s purse would fall to the ground. If a conman swindles you out of money, he loses the exact same amount through tax collectors. If your target is guilty of a crime, is in the middle of criminal activity or has the <em>Criminal </em>Talent, any Damage they inflict upon you is received by them in turn. If a Thug strikes you reducing your Wounds by 4 after modifying for Toughness and Armour, they also lose 4 Wounds. This Miracle works both ways, however, and any crime you commit will be returned upon you in turn.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>"
