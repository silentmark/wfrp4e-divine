      "value": "<p>A black-headed spear of divine origin, this weapon was gifted to Sha’er Khan by an unknown foreign goddess whom he saved battling Eldrazor — her name since having been lost in translation, known in Ind only as the ‘White Maiden’. As a sign friendship, the Tiger God offered to repay the gift one-million-fold to the goddess and her followers. If wielding a spear, your allies gain the <em>Damaging</em> Quality, and each spear counts as Magical. The spearheads turn black, and any Daemons, Elves and Skaven struck by them suffer double the number of Wounds.</p>"
